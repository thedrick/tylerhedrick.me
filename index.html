			<h3>Gilbert</h3>
			<div id="gilbertimg"></div>
			<p> 
				<a href="http://gilbertapp.herokuapp.com">Gilbert</a> is a webapp created during the 36 hour MHacks hackathon at the University of Michigan. The idea behind Gilbert spawned from the frustration in how much code it takes to create custom views on iOS, especially since a lot of that code is repeated. With Gilbert, the user can write some short JSON to describe a view, and get auto-generated Objective-C code to create that view on the iPhone. It also creates an HTML and CSS version of the same view for a mobile web version of the app. The text editors are Ace editors and the backend is written in <a href="http://www.nodejs.org">Node.js</a>. I wrote the backend server and the Objective-C parser while my partner <a href="http://www.stephanieyeung.me">Stephanie Yeung</a> wrote the HTML/CSS parser, both of which are written in Javascript.

			<h3>Lien</h3>
			<div id="lienimg"></div>
			<p>Lien, which stands for "connection" in French, is a social event planning app for the iPhone created during the Tartanhacks hackathon (Jan 2013). I would describe this app as a "Twitter meets Facebook Events" app where you can schedule events and invite your friends in real time, or host a public event for your friends to find and join. The idea for this app came out of trying to coordinate meet-ups with friends via text messaging. Spontaneous get-togethers are not something that would warrant a full Facebook event, but can be annoying to try and plan while coordinating everyone's busy schedule. Lien is meant to be the bridge that fixes this problem. Lien is a work in progress.</p>
			<p> I worked in a small team on this project consisting of Stephanie Yeung, Mitra Raman, and Samaan Ghani. My role was to be the main iOS developer as I had the most experience.</p>

			<h3>Chefmates</h3>
			<div id="chefmatesimg"></div>
			<p>Chefmates is an iPhone app I wrote which is based off a web-app I helped create during the CMU Facebook Hackathon in Fall 2012. The app is designed to make it easy to find and share new recipes based on the items you currently have in your pantry. The recipes are scraped from AllRecipes using a python script, and stored in a database. I used Parse as the backend and utilized their Cloud Code service to handle recipe finding logic. Chefmates is a work in progress</p>
			<p>The original app was done in a team, but the iPhone app has been an individaul project</p>
