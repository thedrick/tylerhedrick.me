		<h2>Hitseeker</h2>
		<p>This is a page created by Tyler Hedrick for Von Ahn's 15-396 at Carnegie Mellon University. You should check out the <a href="http://rzr.online.fr/search.htm#">official Hitseeker page</a> as well as <a href="www.hitseeker.com">hitseeker.com</a> because obviously someone paid to get that domain name for whatever reason. There's also a <a href="hitseeker.tumblr.com">Hitseeker Tumblr Page</a> if you're interested, but really why would you be? These links are just here to increase my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank">PageRank</a> score. There's also a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/TheHitSeekerRecords">Hitseeker Facebook page,</a> but it only has 19 likes so that's pretty unfortunate.</p>

		<p>Other fun things to do, would be to search for Hitseeker in a bunch of different languages. Google has a lot of different non-english sites like <a href="www.google.fr">Google France</a> and <a href="www.google.de">Google Germany!</a> I bet the people who use <a href="https://www.google.it/">Google Italy</a> also enjoy a good marinara sauce, and the people who use <a href="www.google.com.au">Google Australia</a> have seen Kangaroos before. You know, you could still search for pictures of Kangaroos on <a href="http://www.google.es">Google Spain</a> but your results will probably be in Spanish. You could also use something like <a href="www.yahoo.com">Yahoo!</a> or <a href="www.bing.com">Bing,</a> but really, who uses those? Remember <a href="www.dogpile.com">Dogpile</a> and <a href="us.ask.com">Ask Jeeves!?</a> Those were so good.</p>
